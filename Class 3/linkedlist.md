# Linked List

1. Insert ELement at beginning = O(1)
2. Delete ELement at the beginning = O(1)
3. Insert/Delete Element at the end = O(n)
4. Linked list traversal = O(n)
5. Accessing Element By Value = O(n)

Linked list has 2 benefits over an array

1. Don't need to pre-allocate space.
2. Insertion is easier
